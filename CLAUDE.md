# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## When adding or updating a skill

- If a new skill directory is added directly to `skills/`, run `bash install.sh` to create the symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.codex/skills/`.
- Update the skills table in `README.md` whenever a skill is added or its description changes.
